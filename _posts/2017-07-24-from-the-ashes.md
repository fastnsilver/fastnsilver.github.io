It's taken me about 15 years to get back to blogging.  

Back then I self-hosted [my site](https://web.archive.org/web/20020924155614/http://fastnsilver.mine.nu:80/) on a [Gateway G6-200](https://books.google.com/books?id=WVbZSlyrT5kC&pg=PA41&lpg=PA41&dq=gateway+1996+pentium+pro+tower&source=bl&ots=Vu3MTc2T2M&sig=DJ8SjTIl7z12D2QUss7Nd0GQtk8&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwidvf3DhqLVAhUS3GMKHTVeDpsQ6AEIQjAI#v=onepage&q=gateway%201996%20pentium%20pro%20tower&f=false) employing PHP and a nascent blogging framework called [b2](http://cafelog.com) (the predecessor to WordPress); before widespread rollout of broadband and wireless, before podcasting, and before social media.  It was a platform for self-expression.  I shared stories and photos with family and friends.  

Lately, I've had an urge to chronolog my experiences at work.  Particularly about stuff I've gotten mentally stuck on.  So this time around this blog will focus on technology and the practice of software development.  The challenge (with any new writing endeaveor) will be finding a comfortable rhythym and overcoming the urge to edit every thought.
