It's taken me about 15 years to get back to blogging.  

Back then I self-hosted [my site](https://web.archive.org/web/20020924155614/http://fastnsilver.mine.nu:80/) on a [Gateway G6-200](https://books.google.com/books?id=WVbZSlyrT5kC&pg=PA41&lpg=PA41&dq=gateway+1996+pentium+pro+tower&source=bl&ots=Vu3MTc2T2M&sig=DJ8SjTIl7z12D2QUss7Nd0GQtk8&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwidvf3DhqLVAhUS3GMKHTVeDpsQ6AEIQjAI#v=onepage&q=gateway%201996%20pentium%20pro%20tower&f=false) employing PHP and a nascent blogging framework called [b2](https://web.archive.org/web/20171006103655/https://cafelog.com) (the predecessor to WordPress and b2evolution). It was a hand-crafted platform for self-expression, a way for me to share stories, life events and photos with family and friends -- before widespread rollout of broadband and wireless, before podcasting, and before social media.  As services like LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, and Google Photos emerged, I wound up dismantling it.

Fast forward several years, I've always had an urge to chronolog my experiences at work.  Particularly about stuff I've gotten mentally stuck on.  This time around I intend to focus on technology and the practice of software development.  The challenge (with any new writing endeavor) will be finding a comfortable rhythm and overcoming the urge to edit every thought.
